## 1. Behavior of LASSO with very large vs. very small λ

- **Very large λ (strong penalization):**
  - The regularization term dominates, pushing most coefficients towards **zero**.
  - Only variables with the strongest predictive power might survive; many others are completely eliminated.
  - The resulting model is **sparse** and very simple, often underfitting the data.
  - Training error is high because the model cannot capture the complexity of the dataset.
  - Test error is also high, since the model lacks flexibility to generalize well.

- **Very small λ (weak penalization):**
  - The penalty is almost negligible, so coefficients remain close to their OLS estimates.
  - Many variables—including irrelevant ones—remain in the model.
  - Training error becomes very low because the model fits the data closely.
  - However, the risk of **overfitting** increases: the model captures noise, which worsens test error.
  - In extreme cases (λ → 0), LASSO is equivalent to standard linear regression.

**Summary:**  
There is a trade-off:  
- Large λ → high bias, low variance.  
- Small λ → low bias, high variance.  
Cross-validation helps find the λ that balances bias and variance to minimize test error.

## 2. Cross-validation

- **Definition:**  
  Cross-validation is a resampling technique to assess how a model performs on unseen data. It repeatedly splits the dataset into training and validation subsets, fits the model on the training data, and evaluates it on the validation set.  

- **Why it is useful in machine learning:**  
  - Provides a robust estimate of test error without requiring a separate large hold-out set.  
  - Reduces the risk of **overfitting** by testing the model on multiple validation sets.  
  - Guides **hyperparameter tuning** (e.g., choosing the λ in LASSO) by selecting the value that minimizes the average validation error.  
  - Makes efficient use of limited data, since all observations are used for both training and validation across folds.  

- **Illustration (k-fold cross-validation):**  

Imagine splitting the dataset into *k = 5* folds:  
```
Iteration 1: [TEST] | TRAIN | TRAIN | TRAIN | TRAIN
Iteration 2: TRAIN | [TEST] | TRAIN | TRAIN | TRAIN
Iteration 3: TRAIN | TRAIN | [TEST] | TRAIN | TRAIN
Iteration 4: TRAIN | TRAIN | TRAIN | [TEST] | TRAIN
Iteration 5: TRAIN | TRAIN | TRAIN | TRAIN | [TEST]
```
At each iteration, one fold is used as the validation set, while the remaining folds are used for training.  
The **cross-validation error** is the average of validation errors across all iterations, and is used to select the optimal λ.
